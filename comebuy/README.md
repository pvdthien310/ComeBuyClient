## About The Project

_About This Project
 There are many marvelous web applications or websites available on current E-commerce trend market situation. Effortlessness is a myth. We did not find one that really suited our needs so we created this enhanced one. We want to try our best to make a website on our way creatively that fixes and improves our learning in web creating field. We think this is it_

Here's why:
- Our time should be focused on creating something amazing. A Website that describe our creation.
- We also do the same tasks as others which are in the same title
- You should implement more creation into an old title project like this

Of course, our project will no  serve all since you needs may be different. So we try something more interesting such as recommended system into an E-commerce website,..
